# Data Scholars Text Analysis

## Overview

This presentation is a quick exploration of computational text analysis (CTA). We'll begin by discussing very broadly what CTA can do. Then we'll take an interesting question where data is available, preprocess the data, run some statistical models and interpret our results with respect to the question.

## What you'll learn
* What computational text analysis is
* What kinds of questions it can answer
* How to preprocess text data
* How to perform text classification

## Prerequisites

I've been told that all of you have taken Data 8, and that most of you are currently taking or have taken Data 100 and CS61A. This workshop is pitched at that level.

## Getting started & software prerequisites

There are three ways to get started with these materials, with each of them requiring different software installed on your computer.

#### JupyterHub

If you're taking this workshop at D-Lab, then your instructor will have set up JupyterHub for your workshop. The JupyterHub allows you to run code on a remote computer but see the results on yours. For this method, the only software you need is a modern web browser (we suggest Google Chrome). Your instructor will give you a URL on the day. This is our recommended method.

#### Anaconda

If you want to run the code on your computer, you have two options. Both involve installing (or making sure you have installed) Python 3 and some additional libraries. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/) is a **free** product that makes the installation process easy. It bundles together the Python language and a whole bunch of additional packages that we often rely on in our workshops. This way, you only have to download and install one thing. To use this method, visit [this site](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and follow the instructions for your operating system to download the Python 3.x version (it might be 3.6, or 3.7, or higher). **Please, please, please download the 3.x version, not the Python 2.x version**. You may have a choice between using the graphical installer or the command line installer. Use whichever you're comfortable with, but the graphical one is easier.

#### For Pythonistas

If you've been using Python for a while, you might not want to use Anaconda. First, make sure you have a Python 3.x version. Second, install Jupyter by following [these instructions](http://jupyter.org/install). Third, install the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file of this repo. The easiest way to do this is:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## IOKN2K

It's OK Not To Know! That's our motto at [D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/). D-Lab is open to researchers and professionals from all disciplines and levels of experience.
